Here are the 5 mistakes in the resume:

1- Incomplete Information in "Languages" Section: The "Languages" section lists French without a proficiency 
level, making it unclear.

Fix: Add the proficiency level for French. Example:

Languages
● English (Fluent)
● French (Intermediate)

2- Dates Format Inconsistency: The formatting for the years of employment and education is inconsistent. 
The "Project Manager" role uses a full date range, while other roles and education use a partial format.

Fix: Standardize the date format for consistency. Example:

Professional Experience
Project Manager
Innovative Company – New York, USA
2020 - Present

Web Developer
Startup Dynamic – Los Angeles, USA
May 2018 – December 2019

3- Lack of Details in "Web Developer" Role: The job responsibilities are too vague. Mentioning "developed 
a platform for e-commerce" and "created secure payment systems" could be expanded to describe specific 
technologies and achievements.

Fix: Provide more specific details about the tools, technologies, and accomplishments. Example:

Web Developer
Startup Dynamic – Los Angeles, USA
May 2018 – December 2019
● Developed an e-commerce platform using React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
● Designed and implemented secure payment systems with Stripe API.

4- Missing Contact Information Details: The resume includes phone and email but lacks a physical address
 (if needed) or a more specific LinkedIn URL (i.e., using a custom URL rather than a generic link).

Fix: Customize the LinkedIn URL or remove the generic one, and add an address if relevant. Example:

📞 +1 123-456-7890 | 📧 johndoe@email.com | LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/johndoe

5- Education Details Inconsistency: The "Bachelor's in Computer Science" degree lacks dates, which makes it 
incomplete compared to the "Master's in Computer Science."

Fix: Add the dates of the Bachelor's degree. Example:

Education
● Master’s in Computer Science – University of California, 2016–2018
● Bachelor’s in Computer Science – University of Los Angeles, 2012–2016
